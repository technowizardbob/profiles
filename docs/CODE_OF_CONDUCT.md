No trolls welcome....

I would like to build people’s careers up, and not burn bridges...

Think: “Ham Radio Etiquette” -- No cursing, abusive, harassing, or 
condescending behaviors, are acceptable. In other words, 
this is all public record and should be family friendly. As a Ham, 
– one tries to aim for discussions about the radios, and electronics...
Here we should strive to stay on point with the technical project. 
Just as a Ham radio operator does, let's leave behind any political, 
religious, social, or sexual issues at the door. 

My hopes is that all parties will focus on the project and avoid 
disagreements in personal or public communications. Also,
maintain civil politeness in regards to resolving differences...

Notice: However, failure to keep things civil will warrant a 
warning, then banning, if frequent disregard to the warnings...
That said, we encourage people to give others the benefit of the 
doubt regarding their intention... I hope the focus here will 
be of usefulness, sharing, understanding, and of learning 
technology.

TO: All, be awesome, be strong, Enjoy the day & FOSS, have inward peace.

Honestly, I just want to encourage people to have fun and 
avoid arguments if possible. Let's write some code....shall we.

Sincerely, Bob S.
