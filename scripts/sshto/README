All code in scripts/sshto and it's sub-fodlers were based on work by Ivan Marov.
Ivan's repo is a nice smaller script, take a look...at his repo listed above.

What have I added in this adapted form of works:
* Auto config file generation when .ssh folder does not exist:
	- Finds remote servers and tries to create an entry for it from /etc/hosts file.
	- Auto generate RSA/GPG key pairs for a new account.
* $ sshto [optional group based on server names]
	- Just load into view the optional name of servers group
		IE: $ sshto work
* config file "ignore" option...to hide host from main menu
	- IE: Host github #ignore
* Menu Command to copy main Bash Aliases (compresses and creates installer script).

-- Still in progress... See BUGS.txt.
