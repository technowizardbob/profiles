# üö® DSA: It‚Äôs unsafe and even no longer supported since OpenSSH version 7, you need to upgrade it!
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  RSA: It depends on key size. If it has 3072 or 4096-bit length, then you‚Äôre good. Less than that, you probably want to upgrade it. The 1024-bit length is even considered unsafe.
# üëÄ ECDSA: It depends on how well your machine can generate a random number that will be used to create a signature. There‚Äôs also a trustworthiness concern on the NIST curves that being used by ECDSA.
# ‚úÖ Ed25519: It‚Äôs the most recommended public-key algorithm available today!
